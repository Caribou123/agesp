# LIBFT

Libft is the core of any C project @school42.  
In order to use a function in a C project, we need to code it from scratch.  
Using a function that is not part of our Libft is considered as cheating.
(Except for very basic functions such as read or write)  

This library evolves during all our schooling, to adapt to increasingly difficult projects.

It contains functions such as printf, atoi, pow, memcpy, etc..

<h1>Seam carving algorithm</h1>

A Simple yet elegant algorithm invented by Vidya Setlur, Saeko Takage, Ramesh Raskar, Michael Gleicher and Bruce Gooch in 2005.

This java class is a quick implementation of it using the dual-gradient energy function.

How to use :
```
java -jar out/artifacts/SeamCarver/SeamCarver.jar "your-image" "nb-of-vertical-carvings' 'nb-of-horizontal-carvings' 
Additionaly, you can use --show-energy and --show-paths to respectively obtain an energy map and a step by step 
algorithm visualisation.
```
